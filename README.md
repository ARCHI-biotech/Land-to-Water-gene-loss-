# Genome-wide Identification of Vertebrate Homologs Using BLASTN

## Objective

To identify homologous genomic loci of **human genes** across **vertebrate species** by performing **BLASTN searches** against assembled vertebrate genomes using nucleotide sequences derived from **human genome annotation**.

---

## Overview of the Workflow

1. Retrieve human query sequences from annotation  
2. Download vertebrate genome assemblies  
3. Create BLAST nucleotide databases  
4. Perform BLASTN searches  
5. Filter and interpret BLAST hits  
6. Extract genomic coordinates and sequences  
7. Validate orthology
